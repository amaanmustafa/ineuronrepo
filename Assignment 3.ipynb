    "\n",

    "a) Returning a Value: A function can return a single value or an object of any data type. The value being returned can be a result of a computation, a processed data structure, or any other desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) return Statement: The return statement is used to specify the value to be returned. It is typically followed by an expression or variable that evaluates to the desired value. Once a return statement is encountered, the function immediately exits, and the specified value is passed back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Passing Data to the Caller: The return value allows the function to pass data or results back to the part of the program that made the function call. The caller can capture the return value and use it for further processing, assign it to a variable, or utilize it in any other desired \n",
    "\n",
    "No, it is not possible to have a return value in an expression. The return value of a function is distinct from expressions and cannot be directly used as part of an expression.\n",
