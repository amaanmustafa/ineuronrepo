    "*) String: A string is a data type that represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. It can be used to store and manipulate   textual data. For example- my_string = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "Here, \"Hello, world!\" is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "*) Variable: A variable is a name which acts like a container that represents a value stored in the computer's memory. It can be used to store and refer to different types of data, including strings. Variables provide a way to store and retrieve data during the execution of a program. For example: my_variable = 89\n",
    "Here, my_variable is a variable that holds the value 42."

    "*) Integer(int): The integer data type represents whole numbers without any fractional or decimal component. For example: 5, -10, 0. Integers can be used for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "*) String(str): The string data type represents a sequence of characters. Strings are enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). For example: 'Hello', \"Python\", \"123\". Strings can be concatenated, sliced, and manipulated using various string methods. They are commonly used to store and work with textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*) Boolean(bool): The boolean data type represents one of two values: True or False. Booleans are often used in conditional statements and logical operations. They are useful for evaluating conditions and making decisions in a program. For example: True, False. By default True=1 and False=0.\n",

    "\n",
    "*) Comparison Expressions: These expressions compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False). Examples include equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).\n",
    "\n",
    "*) Logical Expressions: These expressions involve logical operators to evaluate conditions and return a Boolean result. Examples include logical AND (and), logical OR (or), and logical NOT (not)."

    "\n",
    "*) Variable names cannot start with a digit: In Python, variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a digit (0-9). Therefore, eggs is a valid variable name as it starts with a letter, but 100 is invalid because it starts with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*) Variable names cannot be solely comprised of digits: Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. They cannot consist only of digits. Python treats such names as numeric literals rather than variable names. Hence, 100 is not a valid variable name."
